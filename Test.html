        Some animals are common, like ants you almost see them everywhere.
        <br>
        there are also animals that are very uncommon, for example "The Northern White Rhino", for example the one under here.
        <br><br>
        <img src ="The Northern White Rhino.jpg" alt ="A Northern White Rhino">
        <br><br>
        there are only a few left on the earth, so we need to pay attention to these animals and try to save them.
        <br>
        These animals are not only dying, there also going extinct.
        <br>
        Going extinct means there are non of your kind left, take the dinosaur for example, there are non of these creatures left.
